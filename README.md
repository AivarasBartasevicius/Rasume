This is a very much in-progress resume project where I'm exploring front-end development. So far, I've primarily focused on testing out project structure, routing, and basic mapping for elements, all data is currently hardcoded.

My front-end understanding is quite minimal, comming from earlier experience with vanilla JavaScript code while i was working with salesforce. I also have minimal React project experience from a Devbridge academy in 2019.

I plan to connect this front-end to a Nest.js back-end for fetching data like experiences, projects, etc., and to handling 'Contact Me' logic using Nodemailer.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
